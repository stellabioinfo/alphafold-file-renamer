# AlphaFold File Renaming Utility

This repository contains a Python notebook used to rename and organize files generated by AlphaFold structure prediction workflows. The script standardizes filenames and prepares the output for clean, reproducible downstream analysis.

## Purpose

AlphaFold often produces files with long or inconsistent names.  
This utility automates the renaming process to:

- Apply a consistent naming pattern  
- Remove unnecessary prefixes or suffixes  
- Maintain an organized directory structure  
- Simplify integration with structural analysis tools  

## What the script does

- Iterates through folders containing AlphaFold output  
- Applies custom renaming rules  
- Produces a clean, standardized set of model files  

## Technologies

- Python  
- Jupyter Notebook  
- OS/path manipulation tools  

## Use Case

This script was used within a structural bioinformatics workflow involving AlphaFold predictions.  
Standardized filenames support downstream tasks such as:

- Structural comparison  
- Domain annotation  
- Model filtering  
- Visualisation or batch analysis  

## Output

A directory of renamed and organized AlphaFold files ready for further computational analysis.
